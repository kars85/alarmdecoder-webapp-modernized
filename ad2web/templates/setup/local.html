			Now we need to know exactly where your device exists at.  Based on your answer to previous questions we've provided the default baudrate for your device as card card-body bg-light p-3 as an example path to it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that the path may vary on all but the AD2PI, which is fixed.  If you're running Linux or OSX your path likely is something similar to '/dev/ttyUSB0', and if it's Windows it will be something similar to 'COM3:'. (The trailing colon is required.)
